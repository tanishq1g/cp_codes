Properties

1) The maximum number of nodes at level ‘l’ of a binary tree is 2^(l-1).
Here level is number of nodes on path from root to the node (including root and node). Level of root is 1.

2) Maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of height ‘h’ is 2^h – 1.
Here height of a tree is maximum number of nodes on root to leaf path. Height of a tree with single node is considered as 1.

3) In a Binary Tree with N nodes, minimum possible height or minimum number of levels is  ? Log2(N+1) ?   
This can be directly derived from point 2 above. If we consider the convention where height of a leaf node is considered as 0, then above formula for minimum possible height becomes Log2(N+1) – 1

4) A Binary Tree with L leaves has at least   ? Log2(L) ? + 1   levels
A Binary tree has maximum number of leaves (and minimum number of levels) when all levels are fully filled. Let all leaves be at level l, then below is true for number of leaves L.

   L   <=  2^(l-1)  [From Point 1]
   l =   Log2(L)  + 1 
   where l is the minimum number of levels. 

5) In Binary tree where every node has 0 or 2 children, number of leaf nodes is always one more than nodes with two children.

    L = T + 1
    Where L = Number of leaf nodes
        T = Number of internal nodes with two children





Full Binary Tree A Binary Tree is full if every node has 0 or 2 children. Following are examples of a full binary tree. We can also say a full binary tree is a binary tree in which all nodes except leaves have two children.

In a Full Binary, number of leaf nodes is number of internal nodes plus 1
       L = I + 1
Where L = Number of leaf nodes, I = Number of internal nodes
